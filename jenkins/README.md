# Create Jenkins Pipeline

## Overview
This project uses Jenkins Pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. The Jenkins Pipeline is defined in a `Jenkinsfile` located at the `jenkins` directory of the repository.

- Follow the Jenkins official documentation for [Jenkins Installation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).
  
## Prerequisites
- Jenkins installed and running
- Jenkins Pipeline plugin installed
- Appropriate credentials and permissions set up in Jenkins
- Access to the necessary build tools and environments (e.g., Docker)

## Pipeline Structure
The pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. **Checkout**: Fetch the latest code from the repository.
2. **Build**: Compile the source code and build the application.
3. **Test**: Run unit and integration tests to verify the application.
4. **Deploy**: Deploy the application to the staging/production environment.

## Getting Started
The `Jenkinsfile` contains the pipeline script.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/project.git](https://github.com/praks7v/BloggersUnity.git)
    cd BloggersUnity
    ```

2. **Configure Jenkins**:
    - Open Jenkins and navigate to the "New Item" page.
    - Create a new Pipeline job and configure it to use the `Jenkinsfile` from the repository.


3. **Run the Pipeline**:
    - Trigger the pipeline manually or configure it to run automatically based on certain triggers (e.g., commit to the repository).


## Environment Variables
Make sure to configure any necessary environment variables in Jenkins for your build and deployment processes.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all paths and commands in the `Jenkinsfile` and `Makefile` are correct.
- Verify Jenkins has the necessary permissions to access the repository and execute the pipeline stages.
- Check the Jenkins logs for detailed error messages if the pipeline fails.
