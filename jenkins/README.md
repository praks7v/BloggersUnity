# Jenkins Pipeline Project

## Overview
This project uses Jenkins Pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. The Jenkins Pipeline is defined in a `Jenkinsfile` located at the root of the repository.

## Prerequisites
- Jenkins installed and running
- Jenkins Pipeline plugin installed
- Appropriate credentials and permissions set up in Jenkins
- Access to the necessary build tools and environments (e.g., Docker)

## Pipeline Structure
The pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. **Checkout**: Fetch the latest code from the repository.
2. **Build**: Compile the source code and build the application.
3. **Test**: Run unit and integration tests to verify the application.
4. **Deploy**: Deploy the application to the staging/production environment.

## Jenkinsfile
The `Jenkinsfile` contains the pipeline script. Below is an example of a basic Jenkins Pipeline script:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout code from version control
                git '[https://github.com/praks7v/BloggersUnity.git](https://github.com/praks7v/BloggersUnity.git)'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build the application
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Run tests
                sh 'make test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    withDockerRegistry(url: 'http://localhost:5000') {
                        sh "docker run -d --rm -it -p 8000:8000 localhost:5000/bloggersunity-web:latest"
                    }
                }
            }
    }

    post {
        success {
            // Notify success
            echo 'Pipeline succeeded!'
        }
        failure {
            // Notify failure
            echo 'Pipeline failed!'
        }
    }
}
```

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/project.git](https://github.com/praks7v/BloggersUnity.git)
    cd BloggersUnity
    ```

2. **Configure Jenkins**:
    - Open Jenkins and navigate to the "New Item" page.
    - Create a new Pipeline job and configure it to use the `Jenkinsfile` from the repository.
    

3. **Run the Pipeline**:
    - Trigger the pipeline manually or configure it to run automatically based on certain triggers (e.g., commit to the repository).

## Makefile
Ensure you have a `Makefile` in the root of your repository with the appropriate commands for building, testing, and deploying your application:

```Makefile
build:
    # Commands to build the application
    @echo "Building the application..."

test:
    # Commands to run tests
    @echo "Running tests..."

deploy:
    # Commands to deploy the application
    @echo "Deploying the application..."
```

## Environment Variables
Make sure to configure any necessary environment variables in Jenkins for your build and deployment processes.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all paths and commands in the `Jenkinsfile` and `Makefile` are correct.
- Verify Jenkins has the necessary permissions to access the repository and execute the pipeline stages.
- Check the Jenkins logs for detailed error messages if the pipeline fails.
